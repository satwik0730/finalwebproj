TIMECAPSULE 

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION :-
We have made a website and we named it as TIMECAPSULE which allows us to travel in past when the 
pre-historic beauties were created by civilizations . This website gives us a detailed knowledge about 
historical monuments across the world . And also we have attached a ticket booking website with it so that 
a user can easily book tickets and enjoy his journey .


FUTURE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT :-

• Businesses benefit from locating in heritage buildings and areas.
• The growth in employment in the restoration industry in construction trades, professionals and product 
manufacturing.
• Enhanced municipal tax base through restored individual buildings and areas
• Increased tourism.
Restoration is often cheaper than new construction.


UNIQUE THINGS WE USED :

• Through this project, we aim to provide a lucid way to get familiar with our India’s magnificent history and check, 
schedule, book and cancel train/flight tickets through a safe and secure payment gateway.
We have used AOS animations in our website.
